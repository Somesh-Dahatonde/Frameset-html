            Linux (/ˈlinʊks/ (About this soundlisten) LEEN-uuks or /ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks) is a family of open-source
            Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on
            September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.<br>

            Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are
            provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free
            Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some
            controversy.<br><br>

            Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include
            Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing
            system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended
            for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely
            redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.<br><br>

            Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since
            been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.[22] Because of the dominance of the
            Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose
            operating systems. Although Linux is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop
            computers, the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates the US K–12
            education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[29] Linux is the
            leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are
            Linux),[30] leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500
            supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors).<br><br>

            Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the
            firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home
            technology, televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs use Tizen and WebOS, respectively),
            automobiles (for example, Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota all rely on Linux), digital
            video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches.The Falcon 9's and the Dragon 2's avionics use a
            customized version of Linux.
            <br>
            Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code
            may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its
            respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License.<br>

        <h2>History</h2>
    </center>

    <p>
        The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs, in the United States by
        Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna.[40] First released in 1971, Unix was written
        entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was
        rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O
        routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different
        computer platforms easier.<br><br>

        Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license
        the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted
        by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal
        obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not
        legally allowed to modify Unix.<br><br>

        The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible
        software system" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984.[42] Later, in 1985, Stallman started
        the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s,
        many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a command-line
        shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and
        the kernel, called GNU Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.<br><br>

        MINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a computer science professor, and released in 1987 as a minimal
        Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn operating system principles.
        Although the complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented it from being
        free software until the licensing changed in April 2000.<br><br>

        Although not released until 1992, due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from which NetBSD, OpenBSD
        and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux.<br><br>

        Linus Torvalds has stated on separate occasions that if the GNU kernel or 386BSD had been available at the time
        (1991), he probably would not have created Linux.<br>

    <p>In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems.[47]
        Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only,[44] he began to work
        on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel.

        Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on
        Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems.[48] GNU
        applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code
        from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other
        computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a
        switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL.Developers
        worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating system

        <h2>Commercial and popular uptake</h2>
    </center>
    <hr>
    <p>Adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists, started to take off first
        in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where organizations such as NASA started to replace their
        increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use
        began when Dell and IBM, followed by Hewlett-Packard, started offering Linux support to escape Microsoft's
        monopoly in the desktop operating system market.

        Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to virtually all
        supercomputers,and have secured a place in server installations such as the popular LAMP application
        stack. Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing.
        Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices shipping with customized
        Linux distributions installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for netbooks.

        Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market, with Android being the
        dominant operating system on smartphones and very popular on tablets and, more recently, on wearables. Linux
        gaming is also on the rise with Valve showing its support for Linux and rolling out SteamOS, its own
        gaming-oriented Linux distribution. Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and
        national governments, such as the federal government of Brazil.</p>
