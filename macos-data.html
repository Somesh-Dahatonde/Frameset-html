            macOS (/ˌmækoʊˈɛs/;[8] previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a proprietary graphical operating system
            developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac
            computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS,
            after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Chrome OS.<br><br>

            macOS succeeded the classic Mac OS, a Macintosh operating system with nine releases from 1984 to 1999.
            During this time, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had left Apple and started another company, NeXT, developing
            the NeXTSTEP platform that would later be acquired by Apple to form the basis of macOS.<br><br>

            The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving
            later that year. All releases from Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[9] and after are UNIX 03 certified,[10] with an
            exception for OS X 10.7 Lion.[11] Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, has been considered a variant of
            macOS.<br><br>

            A prominent part of macOS's original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced "ten" as in
            Mac OS X and also the iPhone X, as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, or places
            within California.[13] Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016 to
            align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. After sixteen distinct
            versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, and macOS Monterey was presented as
            version 12 in 2021.<br><br>

            macOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006,
            Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple
            began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit ARM-based Apple M1 processors on new Mac
            computers.<br><br>

                The heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs
                following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was
                developed, before being launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which
                was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user
                space code derived from parts of BSD.[14] Its graphical user interface was built on top of an
                object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.

                Throughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a "next-generation" OS to succeed its classic Mac
                OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all were eventually abandoned.[15] This led
                Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for
                Apple's next generation operating system.[16] This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as
                an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly
                OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative
                professionals. The project was first code named "Rhapsody" and then officially named Mac OS X

                Mac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh
                computers; until 2020, versions of macOS retained the major version number "10". The letter "X" in Mac
                OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral, and Apple has stated that it should be pronounced
                "ten" in this context. However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter "X".[19][20] Previous
                Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, as with
                Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9.[21][19] As of 2020 and 2021, Apple reverted to Arabic numeral versioning for
                successive releases, macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 12 Monterey, as they have done for the iPhone 11 and
                iPhone 12 following the iPhone X.<br><br>

                The first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface
                resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system.
                Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be
                rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic
                Environment with a reduction in performance.<br><br>

                The consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with
                extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface, but criticizing it for sluggish
                performance.[22] With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such
                as FrameMaker and PageMaker declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.[23] Ars
                Technica columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early
                releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource
                hog'.<br><br>

                Apple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[26] Siracusa's review of version 10.3,
                Panther, noted "It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual
                supply of major new operating system releases."[27] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives
                at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics
                processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable
                performance.<br><br>

                As the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added
                and removed.[29] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music
                software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[30] Targeting the consumer and media markets,
                Apple emphasized its new "digital lifestyle" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home
                entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity
                of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most
                recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.<br><br>

                Newer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the
                striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal
                appearance, or non-pinstriped title bar appearance in version 10.4.[31] In Leopard, Apple announced a
                unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.<br><br>

                In 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.<br><br>

                A key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While
                Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system
                based on Mac OS X, which would later be called "iPhone OS" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two
                operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as
                forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party
                developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers
                showing interest in Mac development.<br><br>

                In 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release with universal binary components, allowing
                installation on both Intel Macs and select PowerPC Macs.[37] It is also the final release with PowerPC
                Mac support. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of OS X to be built exclusively for Intel
                Macs, and the final release with 32-bit Intel Mac support. The name was intended to signal its
                status as an iteration of Leopard, focusing on technical and performance improvements rather than
                user-facing features; indeed it was explicitly branded to developers as being a 'no new features'
                release.[39] Since its release, several OS X or macOS releases (namely OS X Mountain Lion, OS X El
                Capitan, macOS High Sierra, and macOS Monterey) follow this pattern, with a name derived from its
                predecessor, similar to the 'tick–tock model' used by Intel.<br><br>

                In two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly
                skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS while simplifying some elements by
                making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use. This direction was, like brushed metal
                interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in
                the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented
                past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow
                Leopard. In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of
                Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A
                review described the trend in the server products as becoming "cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus
                from large businesses to small ones."<br><br>
