            Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as Windows, is a group of several proprietary graphical operating
            system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain
            sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT;
            these may encompass subfamilies, (e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact) (Windows CE). Defunct
            Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.<br><br>

            Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating
            system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[5]
            Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share,
            overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.<br><br>

            Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on
            products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993). On PCs,
            Windows is still the most popular operating system in all countries.[6][7] However, in 2014, Microsoft
            admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android,[8] because of the massive
            growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that
            of Android devices sold. This comparison, however, may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems
            traditionally target different platforms. Still, numbers for server use of Windows (that are comparable to
            competitors) show one third market share, similar to that for end user use.<br><br>
            As of October 2021, the most recent version of Windows for PCs and tablets is Windows 11, version 21H2. The
            most recent version for embedded devices is Windows 10, version 21H1. The most recent version for server
            computers is Windows Server 2022, version 21H2.[9] A specialized version of Windows also runs on the Xbox
            One and Xbox Series X/S video game consoles.[10]

            Early versions (Windows NT 3.1/3.5/3.51/4.0/2000)<br>
            Main articles: Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000
            In November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment
            Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and
            Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as "NT OS/2". NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user
            operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and
            support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the
            NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as
            Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing
            Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the
            existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now
            Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately
            continued OS/2 development on its own.<br>

            Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel. The hybrid kernel was designed
            as a modified microkernel, influenced by the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon
            University, but without meeting all of the criteria of a pure microkernel.<br>

            The first release of the resulting operating system, Windows NT 3.1 (named to associate it with Windows 3.1)
            was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop workstations and servers. Windows NT 3.5 was released
            in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for Novell's NetWare, and was followed
            up by Windows NT 3.51 in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the PowerPC
            architecture. Windows NT 4.0 was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of Windows 95
            to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0. The Windows
            NT name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the Windows brand.<br>

        <ul>

            <li> Windows XP</li>
            <p>
                He next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released on October 25, 2001. The introduction of
                Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by
                Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based
                predecessors. Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start
                menu and a "task-oriented" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet
                Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, a "compatibility mode" to help provide
                backwards compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance
                functionality.


                At retail, Windows XP was now marketed in two main editions: the "Home" edition was targeted towards
                consumers, while the "Professional" edition was targeted towards business environments and power users,
                and included additional security and networking features. Home and Professional were later accompanied
                by the "Media Center" edition (designed for home theater PCs, with an emphasis on support for DVD
                playback, TV tuner cards, DVR functionality, and remote controls), and the "Tablet PC" edition (designed
                for mobile devices meeting its specifications for a tablet computer, with support for stylus pen input
                and additional pen-enabled applications). Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009.
                Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.

                After Windows 2000, Microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems; the
                server counterpart of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, was released in April 2003. It was followed
                in December 2005, by Windows Server 2003 R2.

            <li>Windows Vista</li>
            <p>After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume
                licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers. It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned
                shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features.
                It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop
                of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC, and stricter license agreement. Vista's server
                counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.</p>

            <br>
            <li>Windows 7</li>
            <p>On July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released as RTM (release to manufacturing)
                while the former was released to the public 3 months later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor,
                Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more
                focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications
                and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible. Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a
                redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain shortcuts to
                files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application,[39] a
                home networking system called HomeGroup,[40] and performance improvements.</p>

            <br>
            <li>Windows 8 and 8.1</li>
            <p>Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of
                significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around
                Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and
                all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient
                for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of
                apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. The new Windows version required a
                minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels,[41] effectively making it unfit for netbooks with 800×600-pixel
                screens.

                Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as
                social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows
                Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that
                utilize the ARM architecture, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots.<br>
                An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1,[49] was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features
                such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and
                Windows 8.1 have been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.</p>

            <br>
            <li>Windows 10</li>
            <p>On September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released on
                July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes
                on PC include the return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows
                Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode. Windows 10 is said to be
                available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from
                the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7).

                In February 2017, Microsoft announced the migration of its Windows source code repository from Perforce
                to Git. This migration involved 3.5 million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository.[51] By May
                2017, 90 percent of its engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds
                per day.

                In June 2021, shortly before Microsoft's announcement of Windows 11, Microsoft updated their lifecycle
                policy pages for Windows 10, revealing that support for their last release of Windows 10 will be October
                14, 2025</p>

            <li>Windows 11</li>
            <p>On June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was announced as the successor to Windows 10 during a livestream. The new
                operating system was designed to be more user-friendly and understandable. It was released on October 5,
                2021.Windows 11 is a free upgrade to some Windows 10 users as of now</p>
